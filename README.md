# Hybrid-Beamforming-for-Millimeter-Wave-Systems-Using-the-MMSE-Criterion

## Introduction
The Matlab Simulation codes for Hybrid Beamforming for Millimeter Wave Systems Using the MMSE Criterion.
This paper is published in IEEE transactions on communications in Jan 2019.
If these codes is help for your work, you can choose to cite the paper, but is not necessary.

Actually this is a simplified version of the original codes, which can be referred to my another repository named "August_mmwave", however, the later is written in a bad form so not easy to read.

I only update the codes for narrowband cases, but the extension to broadband is straightforward, however, I don't have enough time now, so maybe it will be updated in the future.

## How to use
This code is really is to use. First, you should totally add all packages to the path, so you can use these functions. Then, just run the ```main_vs_SNR.m``` file directly. 

## Content
This codes including several algorithms mentioned in my paper, all can easily cited by these convenient APIs. 

## End
I won't update it recently because of limitation of time. However, if you have any problems, you can directly contact me by e-mail: ```lint17@fudan.edu.cn```, I'm glad to help you.

Besides, the broadband codes can be referred to [here](https://github.com/TianLin0509/August_mmwave).
